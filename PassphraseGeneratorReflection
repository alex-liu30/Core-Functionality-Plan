What went well?

I got all the functions to work and I didn't overcomplicate too many aspects of the code.

What was difficult?

Something that was difficult was making sure everything was working. It took me many, many iterations of code to ensure success as I saw many functions that were working but others that for one reason or the other weren't working as intended (even though I thought they would work based on the code that was there)

What was the biggest lesson learned?

The biggest lesson learned was that a great project will take time. I can't expect to just get it on the first try as I did with this assignment, as there are just so many different elements when it comes to making an actual project. Also, many interactions will be necessary to figure out what parts of the project you're missing; for example, I realized my UI was messed up when I typed a number and nothing was working. 

Is there anything that you wish you had gotten do?

I wish I had seen the errors earlier; Not seeing these until scouring the code for quite a bit definitely made me more inefficient with my coding process.

What would you have done differently if doing this project again?

I think I would have researched more about how to make UI the best as possible. My UI was pretty amazing but I want it to be cooler; I will definitely do this research outside of class to hopefully implement it in my next projects.
