Add letter subsitutition function of some kind (e.g. $ dollar sign for s, 3 for an e)
Add number appending function
Implement a way to track/revert modifications

Fourth/Last Step/Issue: Password strength evaluation

Find out how (and then execute) alculate and display entropy (way of measuring how secure passwords are) of current passphrase
